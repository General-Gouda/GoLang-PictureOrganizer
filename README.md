# Picture Organizer

This program will help you sort through the media files within a given directory path.

You provide a source path and a destination path. It will gather information about all of the media files in the source location, weed out any duplicates (based on MD5 hash of the file), and sort the pictures into the destination folder based on Year/Month.

For instance, if a picture within the source directory was created on August 1st, 2009 at 10:19:56 AM it will be sorted into folder `{destinationpath}\2009\August\2009-08-01 101956-{md5hashvalue}.{file extension}`

## How to Use on Windows ##

Open up your favorite command line tool, change directory to where the PictureOrganizer.exe file exists and run the following:

```
.\PictureOrganizer.exe -p "C:\Temp\SourcePath" -d "C:\Temp\DestinationPath"
```

Optionally, you can specify the number of goroutine workers to deploy using the `-w` parameter. Default is set to 10 if nothing is specified.

```
.\PictureOrganizer.exe -p "C:\Temp\SourcePath" -d "C:\Temp\DestinationPath" -w 20
```

## How to Use on Linux ##
Download the source code, install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) and run:

```
go build ./PictureOrganizer.go
```

This should create an executable file within the same folder. You can then run the application using the same argument flags that are listed above `-p -d and -w`

## How to Use the Media File Extensions text file ##
To specify which types of files you want to sort you can create a text file named `mediaFileExtensions.txt` within the same folder as the executable file.

Within this folder you can specify file extensions for any file type you would like.
They must be specified with a period in front of the file extensions:

```
.JPG
.AVI
.MOV
```

If a `mediaFileExtensions.txt` file is not found the program will use this hard-coded list of file extensions by default:

```
.JPG
.JPEG
.HEIC
.MP4
.MOV
.HEVC
.PNG
.JPEG
.GIF
.TIF
.BMP
.AVI
```

The program will also create a new file and place these file extensions within a file in the same directory as the exe automatically.
